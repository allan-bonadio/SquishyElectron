How this was Built

This runs in a browser, so there's a limit to what the code can do.  Even though, there's pretty butch tools available as of 2021.

Most of the code is JavaScript, running in the browser, just like any other website.

The numerical  integration, and most other time-critical numerical calculations, are done in C++ using Emscripten.  It uses an RK4 integrator, which is a high-precision way of integrating ordinary differential equations.

The graphics are done in WebGL, a blindingly fast graphics rendering engine.  Basically, it allows you to directly use the GPU in your computer to draw stuff.  Most of the graphics done on your screen, for all programs, is done using a similar interface to the GPU called OpenGL; this is how you get gradients, transparency and shadows with minimal overhead.
