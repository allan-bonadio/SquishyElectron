So, I'm grabbing a can.  A piece of steel, that's used to wrap food, in this case, refried beans.  The outside of the can is cool and solid; I just took it out of the refrigerator.  I ripped off the paper label, so the metal underneath feels cool and solid.  Maybe it's galvanized, plated in zinc, just a thin latyer.  It's steel, mostly iron metal.  It  feels smooth and solid.  Actually, it's got ribs around the circumference of the can, maybe to make it stronger yet.  It feels to me like a perfectly smooth surface.

But, it isn't really smooth.  If I could zoom in, a factor of more than a billion, I could start to see the atoms that make it happen.  There's hydrogen atoms, but not too many.  Mostly, zinc atoms, because it's plated in zinc; don't worry, zinc is in the form of atoms anyway.  So, you run your fingers along this smooth zinc surface.  It feels smooth, but, really, each Zinc atom is a lump, at a microscopic level.  But, in the manufacturing process, they try to smooth these lumps out, at least at the 1:billion scale.  So, all your zinc lumps flatten out to a single layer.

The problem is, the fingers I use to feel my way along the steel can, are also made of atoms.  And, those atoms are, pretty much, as lumpy as the Zinc atoms in the can.  So, this is lumpy on lumpy, and as i run my finters along hte sufrace of the can, it feels smooht fr me, but at a microscompic level, it;s just as lumpy as before.

So, lets look at this level of fuzz.  Each electron is captured by a Zinc atom.  So it's not going far from its original atom.  Zinc atoms are pretty hard-core.  But, there is a layer of outside-shell electrons that zip around across the length of the zinc palating.  They have permission to travel, far and wide.

Is ther esomethingt i can say
that'l makey you come my wayy?
