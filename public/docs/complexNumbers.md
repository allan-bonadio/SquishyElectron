<h1>Complex Number refresher</h1>


Complex numbers are those that consist of two real numbers like this:

<var>a</var> + <var>b i</var>

<var>a<var> is called the 'real part' and <var>b<var> is called the 'imaginary part'.  <var>i<var> is the square root of -1, which is impossible to do using only real numbers.  There are no real numbers that make this true:

i<sup>2</sup> = -1
